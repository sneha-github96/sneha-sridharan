# Hey there!

Thank you for carving out time to skim through my profile. Let me tell you a bit about myself.

Hello, my name is Sneha Sridharan, and I am a Technical Writer. My primary focus is to translate technical information into user-friendly, easy-to-understand help content. I strongly believe that technical writing is more about assisting people, including those who are stressed, have limited experiences, or may have insufficient context, to accomplish their goals without roadblocks.

I build and maintain technical documents for both end users and developers. My favorite element of my job is having the bandwidth to learn new things about technical writing and developer relations on a daily basis, as well as going through the nuances of curating well-organized, transparent documentation.
